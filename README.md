The analysis scheme for the wide-field setup consists on three Julia notebooks. The first two construct the spectra of the fields taken from a sample, and the third one analyzes the photobleaching behavior of the ROI in the sample to study. This last notebook applies the "AutoStepFinder" algorithm.
To be able to run the notebooks, apart from installing Julia and Pluto, some ingredients are needed. These ingredients are jl codes containing the core of the ASF algorithm.
